# ECE449
Senior Design Repository
You will need all of the files in the respository in the same folder on your Rasbperry pi. The files titled
originalx.cpp are the actual code files and each number denotes a new iteration. You need to compile the C++ 
before you run it. All the files name SeniorDesingxx are the executable files from compiling one of Original.cpp 
files. Make sure you have the A/D converter wired to the correct pins, there should be a pin out file in the 
github directory as well as comments in the code denote which inputs are used. Be aware that the number for GPIO 
pin being used and the number used in the code are not the same i.e. pin 18 on the Pi is not 18 in the code.
If you have quesions on anything please feel free to contact me(Eric) at ESDowns88@gmail.com I will be glade to 
help.
